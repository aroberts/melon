Command line parsing:
* melon [<opts>] <cmd> <cmd-params> [<cmd-opts>]
* pivot on <cmd>, melon opts come before cmd, cmd-opts come after
* this may make it hard to guess at unrecognized commands
* commands don't have a dash

Testing:
* fix rcov rake world

Commands:
* a command helper that
  * dynamically makes the collection "commands" from files in commands/*
  * figures out the padding for the banner

  * google "ruby get all classes declared in a directory"
