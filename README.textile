A media file cataloging tool.

h2. Synopsis

Melon is a tool for tracking files based on content, aiming
to scale to arbitrarily large files without slowing down.  It uses
a sparse hashing algorithm to generate a digest without having to
read the whole file, allowing it to go much faster than disk would
ordinarily allow.

h2. Installation

<pre>
gem install melon
</pre>

TODO

h2. Motivation

"Is this file copied onto my media drive yet?"
